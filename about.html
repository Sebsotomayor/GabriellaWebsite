                    <p>
                        I'm Gabriella Cortes-Alban, a senior at the University of Central Florida
                         pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Interdisciplinary Studies with concentrations
                          in commerce, public affairs, nonprofit management, and performing arts
                           administration. I combine my academic training with a professional career 
                           as a performing artist to bring innovative perspectives to fundraising,
                            program development, and public communications.
                        <br><br>
                           Born into a Colombian family in Florida, I grew up immersed in 
                           culture and community advocacy. Working at my father's medical 
                           practice to support uninsured patients and performing traditional 
                           Latin music with my mother's entertainment company taught me early
                            on that art and service are not opposites, but complementary colors
                             on the same canvas.
                             <br><br>
                            I continued to work across healthcare, education, and
                             philanthropyâ€”mentoring youth, coordinating health education
                              programs, analyzing grants, and curating community events. 
                              While each role carried moments of joy, I found my true purpose 
                              when these seemingly separate paths converged through the arts, 
                              bringing healing to people from all walks of life.
                              <br><br>
                            Based in Orlando, I work as an independent artist collaborating 
                            with companies such as Eklectic Entertainment, Stepflix Entertainment,
                             and Adanse Productions on corporate, theme park, and live performance 
                             projects. Trained in ballroom and Latin styles, I also teach students of 
                             all ages, believing that dance and music are powerful ways to channel 
                             energy and enrich lives.
                             <br><br>
                            These unique experiences provide fresh perspectives that inspire 
                            creative approaches to organizational growth, community engagement, 
                            and fundraising initiatives, enabling me to consult local businesses 
                            and nonprofits with strategic planning and public relations.
                            <br><br>
                            Grateful for the opportunities that allowed me to grow, 
                            I am passionate about providing equitable support to those 
                            who do not have the same. I put this philosophy into action through 
                            <i>Sembrando Arte, Cosechando Esperanzas</i>, a project that uses entertainment 
                            to fund youth programs addressing mental health through arts and culture.
                            <br><br>
                            My vision is to challenge society's black-and-white 
                            standards and instead invite people to see life in full 
                            color by bridging communities, amplifying voices, and 
                            creating change through the power of art.
