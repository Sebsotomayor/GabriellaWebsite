                    <p>
                        I'm Gabriella Cortes-Alban, an interdisciplinary professional and performing artist about to graduate 
                        with a Bachelor of Science in Interdisciplinary Studies from the University of Central Florida. 
                        I blend my studies in commerce, public affairs, nonprofit management, and performing arts administration 
                        with my work on stage to unite creativity and strategy in fundraising, program development, and community 
                        engagement.

                        <br><br>

                        Growing up immersed in culture and community advocacy through my father's immigrant-focused medical practice 
                        and my mother's Latin entertainment company, I learned early on that art and service are not opposites but 
                        complementary colors on the same canvas.

                        <br><br>

                        Working across healthcare, education, and philanthropy, I discovered my purpose where these paths meet, 
                        using the arts to bring healing and connection to people from all walks of life. 

                        <br><br>

                        Today, I'm based in Orlando, performing as a vocalist and dancer on corporate, theme park, and community stages, 
                        also  leading workshops that help others channel their emotions through art and empowerment.

                        <br><br>

                        These experiences shape the creative lens I bring when collaborating with local businesses and nonprofits.

                        <br><br>

                         My vision is to challenge society's black-and-white standards and invite people to see life in full color, 
                         creating change through the power of art.
